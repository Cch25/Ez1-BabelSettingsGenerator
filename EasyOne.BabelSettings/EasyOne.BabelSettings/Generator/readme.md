#Please read the instructions.
Your ***Input.cs*** file in the Generator folder is responsible for reading your properties. 
#The properties MUST be put inside a BabelSettings class.!!!
We have support for Complex types (make sure you add the class for the type)
#Supported values: 
  ***(string, Guid, int, short, double, long, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, bool,
  ***         Guid?,int?,short?,double?,long?,DateTime?,DateTimeOffset?,bool?);
#Lists are not supported 
  ***defaultsettings can't understand them, so please remove them from the code below
#Flags supported by the app: [-lang] [-settingCode]
   ***IF NOT present [-lang] provides default to -> it
   ***IF NOT present [-override] provides default to -> false
   ***IF NOT present [-settingCode] provides default to -> gridContainerDefaultSettingsAutoGenerated
#Appsettings.json can be configured to support mongob connection string.
  *This is an optional requirement, if settings are not present it will ignore this step
**After the program completes you will have a file inside Generator folder [provided-name].json with your latest action
**We recommend providing appsettings connection string so we can correctly update your latest action.
#eg.:
```
public class BabelSettings
{
     public int Age { get; set; }
     public string Name { get; set; }
     public bool OverEighteen { get; set; }
     public Complex Complex { get; set; } //this is supported 
     public List<Complex> Complexes { get; set; } //this is not supported, please remove.	
}

 public class Complex {
   public int Child1 { get; set; }
   public string Child2 { get; set; }
   public ComplexInside ComplexInsideComplex { get; set; }
}
 
 public class ComplexInside{
   public int? ChildChild1 { get; set; }
   public double? ChildChild2 { get; set; }
 }
 ```
